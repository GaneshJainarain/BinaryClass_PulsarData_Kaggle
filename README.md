## Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 10
### Binary Classification with a Pulsar Dataset

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Pulsar Classification. 

#### `Files`

- train.csv - the training dataset; Class is the (binary) target
- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of Class
(whether the observation is a pulsar)
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

### Data Science Framework & Process

- Define the Problem
- Gather the Data
- Prepare Data for Consumption
- Perform Exploratory Analysis
- Model Data
- Validate and Implement Data Model
- Optimize and Strategize

#### `Defining Our Problem`

`Predict the probability of the variable Class`

Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars, extremely dense stars composed almost entirely of neutrons and having a diameter of only 20 km (12 miles) or less. Pulsar masses range between 1.18 and 1.97 times that of the Sun, but most pulsars have a mass 1.35 times that of the Sun.

Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter . Neutron stars are very dense, and have short, regular rotational periods. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. Pulsars are believed to be one of the candidates for the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.
